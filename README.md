## Summary

### Accuracy-Competition

+ FE: adding a `weekends` feature.

+ I used 4 single models:
    
    + time series split 3 fold cv - rmse loss function
    
    + [time series split 3 fold cv - poisson loss function](https://www.kaggle.com/rikdifos/timeseriessplit-cv-poisson)
    
    + time series split 3 fold cv - self-defined loss function
    
    + rolling prediction

+ Then I calculate all prediction's mean value, the I recode very tiny prediction to 0. Finally, I use a magic multiplier close to 1.

### Uncertainty-Competition

+ Use [public kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/szmnkrisz97/point-to-uncertainty-different-ranges-per-level) released by [KrisztianSz](https://www.kaggle.com/szmnkrisz97) to convert point prediction to uncertainty. I use accuracy final submission as input and get a single submission 1.

+ Use a [public kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/ulrich07/quantile-regression-with-keras) released by [Ulrich GOUE](https://www.kaggle.com/ulrich07) as a single submission 2.

+ Finally, I did an averaging from above 2 submission files and convert all negative prediction to 0.

# Happy Kaggling!
